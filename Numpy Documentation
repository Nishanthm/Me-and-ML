->What is Numpy ?
a) NumPy is a Python package which stands for ‘Numerical Python’. 
b) It is the core library for scientific computing, which contains a powerful n-dimensional array object. 
c)NumPy array can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container for generic data.

->How to Import a numpy package?
Code: import numpy as np

->How to create an empty numpy array filled with zeros?
Code: 
           X = np.zeros((3,2),float)
           Y= np.zeros_like(X)
           
->How to create a 3-D array with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere?
Code: np.eye(3)
The matrix created will be 
  array([[ 1.,  0.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  1.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  1.]])

->How to create a numpy array from a python list?
Code: x=np.array([1, 2, 3])

->How to create an integer numpy array into float?
Code: x = [1, 2]
      y=np.asfarray(x)

->How to create a numpy ndarray with numbers spaced with
equal spacing within the given range?
Code: x=np.arange(start,end,step)

->How to reshape a numpy array into desired shape?
Code: x=np.arange(6)
      x.shape=(3,2)

->How to create a 1-D array of 50 evenly spaced elements between 3. and 10., inclusive?
Code: np.linspace(3., 10, 50)

->How to get the diagonal elements of a matrix
Code: y=np.diag(X)

->How to create a 2-D array whose diagonal equals [1, 2, 3, 4] and 0's elsewhere.
Code: np.diagflat([1, 2, 3, 4])

->How to reshape a numpy array?
Code: 
           x = np.ones([10, 10, 3])
           out = np.reshape(x, [-1, 150])

->Dot product of two matrices
Code: 
           x = [1,2]
           y = [[4, 1], [2, 2]]
           print np.dot(x, y)
           
->How to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix using numpy?
Code:
x = np.diag((1, 2, 3))
eigenvals = np.linalg.eig(x)[0]
eigenvecs = np.linalg.eig(x)[1]
